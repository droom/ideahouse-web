            p.transition.hidden Pad printing is the process used to transfer ink from an etched printing plate onto any kind of surface using a silicone rubber pad. The main advantage of this method is it has the ability to print on any kind of irregular surface. It is more suited for small print areas rather than larger ones.
            p.transition.hidden A block charge is applicable to produce the etched printing plate. The type of ink required differs according to the material (plastic/metal) you wish to print on.

            p.transition.hidden Silkscreen printing uses a fine mesh stretched tightly onto a frame. A negative design is created on the screen and ink is pushed through with a squeegee, making direct contact on the object. This printing is suited for medium to large sized prints. One colour is considered one print.
            p.transition.hidden A block charge is applicable to create a silkscreen.
